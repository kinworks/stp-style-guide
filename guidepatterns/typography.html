<!-- We hook to classes to set the type sizes
here - you can set the sizes however you like,
we just didn't want to define them against specific heading tags 
(h1, h2 etc) when that might not make sense in all contexts -->

<h1 class="heading heading__large">Large Heading (2em)</h1>

<h2 class="heading heading__medium">Medium Heading (1.75em)</h2>

<h3 class="heading heading__small">Small Heading (1.5em)</h3>

This is a lead (or lede), a paragraph in literature that is the opening paragraph of an article, essay, news story or book chapter. It usually occurs together with the headline or title. It precedes the main body of the content. It's set in 1.3em URW Franklin Gothic loaded in from Typekit, in 400 weight. We're using $mid-aqua for this text, and never use $aqua for text on a $white background as it doesn't conform to accessibility requirements for colour contrast.

<p>This is a text paragraph set in 1.1em URW Franklin Gothic loaded in from Typekit. The weight used in 'regular' text is 400. The weight used for <b>bold text</b> is 500. Speaking of formatting, the <i>italic style should probably be in here too.</i></p>
